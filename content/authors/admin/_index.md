I am a passionate data scientist and I am using my skills to solve challenging real-world problems by using machine learning, data mining, and other types of data analytics and data visualization tools such as R, Python, etc.

Currently, I am working as a lecturer at Marmara University in Istanbul, Turkey. My research interests include big data, data mining, criminology and information systems (e.g., GIS).
