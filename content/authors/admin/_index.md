As a researcher with a PhD, I specialise in leveraging big data, machine learning, deep learning, and geospatial analytics to solve complex real-world problems. My expertise includes spatial and spatiotemporal analyses, remote sensing through satellite imagery, and the integration of geographic information systems with advanced artificial intelligence models. I have practical experience with cloud platforms and am proficient in data analysis and deep learning frameworks. Recently, my research has expanded into Vision-based Large Language Models and Multimodal AI, exploring innovative solutions at the intersection of AI and geospatial data science.
