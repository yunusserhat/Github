I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Bureau Management and Executive Assistantship](http://bys.sbmyo.marmara.edu.tr) at Marmara University. 

After January 2023, however, I will research criminology, big data, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and spatial-temporal prediction as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute) at the University College London.

Most of my interests are in data science, big data, AI, information systems (e.g., GIS), and geospatial. My overall research goal is to be able to solve challenging real-world problems by using machine learning, deep learning, data science, and other types of analytics and visualization tools such as Python, R, and SQL.
