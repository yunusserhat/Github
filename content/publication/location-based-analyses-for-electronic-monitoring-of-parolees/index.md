abstract: This study analyses the spatio-temporal pattern of parolees using
  electronic monitoring, where the developed spatial framework supports the
  Environmental Criminology concepts such as crime patterns or crime attractive
  locations. A grid-based solution for spatio-temporal analyses is introduced to
  ensure the anonymity of the parolees. In order to test these developed
  concepts, the Istanbul Metropolitan Area was selected as the pilot study area.
  Following the developed concepts of the Crime Pattern Theory, a spatial
  framework was designed. A novel grid-based weighted algorithm for the most
  attractive areas was generated via spatial point-of-interest data and a
  conducted survey among police officers. The designed framework and the
  spatio-temporal analyses were carried out for 77 parolees using geostatistical
  methods. The major findings of the study are (a) 24-hour trajectories of each
  parolee was monitored; (b) the most attractive grids within the city were
  defined; and (c) for each parolee, the entrance time to the grid and the time
  spent within that grid were reported and analyzed. This study is a preliminary
  study for spatio-temporal detection of parolees&rsquo; trajectories, where
  location-based analyses serve well. This study aims to aid decision-makers to
  better monitor the parolees and justify the benefits of surveillance.
